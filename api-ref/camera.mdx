## GetFov

This function returns the field of view (FOV) value, which is already converted from radians to degrees

```lua
camera.GetFov()
```

## SetFov

The `SetFov` function adjusts the camera's field of view to the specified value. This value is input in degrees, and the function automatically converts it to radians for internal processing

```lua
camera.SetFov(value)
```

## GetPosition

The `GetPosition` function retrieves the current position of the camera, returning it as a `Vector3`. This allows for precise manipulation and assessment of the camera's location in 3D space

```lua
camera.GetPosition()
```

## SetPosition

The `SetPosition` function assigns a new position to the camera based on the specified `Vector3` value

```lua
camera.SetPosition(Vector3: x, y, z)
```

## GetRotation

The `GetRotation` function retrieves the current orientation of the camera, returning it as a `Matrix3`

```lua
camera.GetRotation()
```

## SetRotation

The `SetRotation` function adjusts the camera's orientation based on the specified `Matrix3` values

```lua
camera.SetRotation(Matrix3)
```

## GetSubject

The `GetSubject` function retrieves the instance that the camera is currently assigned to, allowing you to identify what object or entity the camera is focused on

```lua
camera.GetSubject()
```

## SetSubject

The `SetSubject` function allows you to set the camera's focus to a specific instance. By passing the desired instance as a parameter, you can direct the camera's attention to that particular object or entity within the scene

```lua
camera.SetSubject(Instance)
```
